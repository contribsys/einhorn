* Switch the command-socket protocol from line-oriented JSON to
  line-oriented YAML. If you've written your own client to communicate
  with the einhorn command-socket, you will need to update it. (The
  bundled einhorn/client is already updated.)
* Have the 'state' command return a YAML'd state rather than a #pretty_inspect'd
  state
* Made einhornsh script-friendly
* Switched over to address specification via -b option and environment variables;
  deprecated but didn't remove old interface.
* Allow einhorn to signal a given worker multiple times
* Add 'signal' command to Einhornsh
