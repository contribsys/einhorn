# == Synopsis
# LittlePlugger is a module that provides Gem based plugin management.
# By extending your own class or module with LittlePlugger you can easily
# manage the loading and initializing of plugins provided by other gems.
#
# == Details
# Plugins are great! They allow other developers to add functionality to
# an application but relieve the application developer of the responsibility
# for mainting some other developer's plugin code. LittlePlugger aims to
# make it dead simple to manage external plugins as gems.
#
# === Naming
# Every plugin managed by LittlePlugger will have a name represented as a
# Symbol. This name is used to register the plugin, load the plugin file,
# and manage the plugin class/module. Here are the three rules for plugin
# names:
#
# 1) all lowercase with underscores
# 2) maps to a file of the same name with an '.rb' extension
# 3) converting the name to camel case yields the plugin class / module
#
# These rules are essentially the standard ruby practice of naming files
# after the class / module the file defines.
#
# === Finding & Loading
# Plugins are found by searching through the lib folders of all installed
# gems; these gems are not necessarily loaded - just searched. If the lib
# folder has a subdirectory that matches the +plugin_path+, then all ruby
# files in the gem's +plugin_path+ are noted for later loading.
#
# A file is only loaded if the basename of the file matches one of the
# registered plugin names. If no plugins are registered, then every file in
# the +plugin_path+ is loaded.
#
# The plugin classes / modules are all expected to live in the same
# namespace for a particular application. For example, all plugins for the
# "Foo" application should reside in a "Foo::Plugins" namespace. This allows
# the plugins to be automatically initialized by LittlePlugger.
#
# === Initializing
# Optionally, plugins can provide an initialization method for running any
# setup code needed by the plugin. This initialize method should be named as
# follows: "initializer_#{plugin_name}" where the name of the plugin is
# appended to the end of the initializer method name.
#
# If this method exists, it will be called automatically when plugins are
# loaded. The order of loading of initialization is not strictly defined, so
# do not rely on another plugin being initialized for your own plugin
# successfully initialize.
#
# == Usage
# LittlePlugger is used by extending your own class or module with the
# LittlePlugger module.
#
#    module Logging
#      extend LittlePlugger
#    end
#
# This defines a +plugin_path+ and a +plugin_module+ for our Logging module.
# The +plugin_path+ is set to "logging/plugins", and therefore, the
# +plugin_modlue+ is defined as Logging::Plugins. All plugins for the
# Logging module should be found underneath this plugin module.
#
# The plugins for the Logging module are loaded and initialized by calling
# the +initialize_plugins+ method.
#
#    Logging.initialize_plugins
#
# If you only want to load the plugin files but not initialize the plugin
# classes / modules then you can call the +load_plugins+ method.
#
#    Logging.load_plugins
#
# Finally, you can get a hash of all the loaded plugins.
#
#    Logging.plugins
#
# This returns a hash keyed by the plugin names with the plugin class /
# module as the value.
#
# If you only want a certain set of plugins to be loaded, then pass the
# names to the +plugin+ method.
#
#    Logging.plugin :foo, :bar, :baz
#
# Now only three plugins for the Logging module will be loaded.
#
# === Customizing
# LittlePlugger allows the use of a custom plugin path and module. These are
# specified when extending with LilttlePlugger by passing the specific path
# and module to LittlePlugger.
#
#    class Hoe
#      extend LittlePlugger( :path => 'hoe', :module => Hoe )
#
#      plugin(
#          :clean, :debug, :deps, :flay, :flog, :package,
#          :publish, :rcov, :signing, :test
#      )
#    end
#
# All ruby files found under the "hoe" directory will be treated as
# plugins, and the plugin classes / modules should reside directly under the
# Hoe namespace.
#
# We also specify a list of plugins to be loaded. Only these plugins will be
# loaded and initialized by the LittlePlugger module. The +plugin+ method
# can be called multiple times to add more plugins.
