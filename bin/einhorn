## Usage

Einhorn is the language-independent shared socket manager. Run
`einhorn -h` to see detailed usage. At a high level, usage looks like
the following:

    einhorn [options] program

Einhorn will open one or more shared sockets and run multiple copies
of your process. You can seamlessly reload your code, dynamically
reconfigure Einhorn, and more.

      if long
        usage << <<EOF

## Overview

To set Einhorn up as a master process running 3 copies of `sleep 5`:

    $ einhorn -n 3 sleep 5

You can communicate your running Einhorn process via `einhornsh`:

    $ einhornsh
    Welcome gdb! You are speaking to Einhorn Master Process 11902
    Enter 'help' if you're not sure what to do.

    Type "quit" or "exit" to quit at any time
    > help
    You are speaking to the Einhorn command socket. You can run the following commands:
    ...

### Server sockets

If your process is a server and listens on one or more sockets,
Einhorn can open these sockets and pass them to the workers. You can
specify the addresses to bind by passing one or more `-b ADDR`
arguments:

    einhorn -b 127.0.0.1:1234 my-command
    einhorn -b 127.0.0.1:1234,r -b 127.0.0.1:1235 my-command

Each address is specified as an ip/port pair, possibly accompanied by options:

    ADDR := (IP:PORT)[<,OPT>...]

In the worker process, the opened file descriptors will be represented
as file descriptor numbers in a series of environment variables named
EINHORN_FD_0, EINHORN_FD_1, etc. (respecting the order that the `-b`
options were provided in), with the total number of file descriptors
in the EINHORN_FD_COUNT environment variable:

    EINHORN_FD_0="6" # 127.0.0.1:1234
    EINHORN_FD_COUNT="1"

    EINHORN_FD_0="6" # 127.0.0.1:1234,r
    EINHORN_FD_1="7" # 127.0.0.1:1235
    EINHORN_FD_COUNT="2"

Valid opts are:

    r, so_reuseaddr: set SO_REUSEADDR on the server socket
    n, o_nonblock: set O_NONBLOCK on the server socket

You can for example run:

    $ einhorn -b 127.0.0.1:2345,r -m manual -n 4 -- example/time_server

Which will run 4 copies of

    EINHORN_FD_0=6 EINHORN_FD_COUNT=1 example/time_server

Where file descriptor 6 is a server socket bound to `127.0.0.1:2345`
and with `SO_REUSEADDR` set. It is then your application's job to
figure out how to `accept()` on this file descriptor.

### Command socket

Einhorn opens a UNIX socket to which you can send commands (run
`help` in `einhornsh` to see what admin commands you can
run). Einhorn relies on file permissions to ensure that no malicious
users can gain access. Run with a `-d DIRECTORY` to change the
directory where the socket will live.

Note that the command socket uses a line-oriented YAML protocol, and
you should ensure you trust clients to send arbitrary YAML messages
into your process.

### Seamless upgrades

You can cause your code to be seamlessly reloaded by upgrading the
worker code on disk and running

    $ einhornsh
    ...
    > upgrade

Once the new workers have been spawned, Einhorn will send each old
worker a SIGUSR2. SIGUSR2 should be interpreted as a request for a
graceful shutdown.

### ACKs

After Einhorn spawns a worker, it will only consider the worker up
once it has received an ACK. Currently two ACK mechanisms are
supported: manual and timer.

#### Manual ACK

A manual ACK (configured by providing a `-m manual`) requires your
application to send a command to the command socket once it's
ready. This is the safest ACK mechanism. If you're writing in Ruby,
just do

    require 'einhorn/worker'
    Einhorn::Worker.ack!

in your worker code. If you're writing in a different language, or
don't want to include Einhorn in your namespace, you can send the
string

    {"command":"worker:ack", "pid":PID}

to the UNIX socket pointed to by the environment variable
`EINHORN_SOCK_PATH`. (Be sure to include a trailing newline.)

To make things even easier, you can pass a `-g` to Einhorn, in which
case you just need to `write()` the above message to the open file
descriptor pointed to by `EINHORN_SOCK_FD`.

(See `lib/einhorn/worker.rb` for details of these and other socket
discovery mechanisms.)

#### Timer ACK [default]

By default, Einhorn will use a timer ACK of 1 second. That means that
if your process hasn't exited after 1 second, it is considered ACK'd
and healthy. You can modify this timeout to be more appropriate for
your application (and even set to 0 if desired). Just pass a `-m
FLOAT`.

### Preloading

If you're running a Ruby process, Einhorn can optionally preload its
code, so it only has to load the code once per upgrade rather than
once per worker process. This also saves on memory overhead, since all
of the code in these processes will be stored only once using your
operating system's copy-on-write features.

To use preloading, just give Einhorn a `-p PATH_TO_CODE`, and make
sure you've defined an `einhorn_main` method.

In order to maximize compatibility, we've worked to minimize Einhorn's
dependencies. It has no dependencies outside of the Ruby standard
library.

### Command name

You can set the name that Einhorn and your workers show in PS. Just
pass `-c <name>`.
